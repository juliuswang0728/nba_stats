# nba_stats

This is part of my info viz project at Aalto University. I extract nba team stats
from ESPN website (http://espn.go.com/nba/teams).

The goal of this project is to discover the most possible secret sauce of nba champs by
analysing champ team's stats each year from 1991 (chicago-bulls) to 2015 (golden-state-warriors).

The results and the reports will be updated soon...tentative results would be published in
'results' directory.

I use the following python package:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib (for general plotting purpose)
- seaborn (color schemes they offer looks nicer for me)
- BeautifulSoup (for parsing websites)
